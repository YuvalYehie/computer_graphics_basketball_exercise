## Implemented Features

Mandatory Interactive and Physics-Based Features 

1. Physics-Based Basketball Movement:
    - Realistic gravity simulation affecting basketball trajectory
    - Proper arc physics for basketball shots
    - Ball bouncing mechanics with energy loss
    - Ground collision detection and response
    - Hoop/rim collision detection for successful shots
2. Interactive Basketball Controls:
    - Arrow keys for horizontal basketball movement (left/right, forward/backward)
    - W/S keys for adjusting shot power (increase/decrease vertical force)
    - Spacebar to shoot the basketball
    - R key to reset the ball position to center court
3. Basketball Rotation Animations:
    - Rotation applied during ball movement and flight
    - Rotation axis aligns with movement direction
    - Speed of rotation scales with velocity
    - Smooth transition effects during rotation
4. Comprehensive Scoring System:
    - Tracks score in real-time
    - Counts shot attempts
    - Calculates shooting accuracy percentage
    - Updates score immediately upon successful shot
    - Displays visual feedback for both successful and missed shots
5. Enhanced User Interface:
    - Live scoreboard showing current score
    - Displays total attempts and shooting percentage
    - Visual shot power indicator
    - Control instructions visible on screen
    - Game messages like ‚ÄúSHOT MADE!‚Äù or ‚ÄúMISSED SHOT‚Äù
6. External Assets:
    - Sound effects for shot success/failure (can be found in source/audio)
    
## Bonus Features 
The following advanced features were implemented in addition to the required ones:

1. Multiple Hoops:
    - Shooting system supports both hoops, automatically aiming toward the nearest one.
2. Combo System:
    - Bonus points are awarded for consecutive successful shots, encouraging streaks.
3. Time Challenge Mode:
    - A countdown-based timed mode adds pressure and competitiveness.
4. Sound Effects:
    - Realistic audio cues for shooting, bouncing, and scoring enhance immersion.
5. Ball Trail Effect:
    - A visual trail follows the basketball in flight, improving shot clarity and aesthetics.
